Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML file format. This model is a collection of files that describe a robot's physical description to ROS (Robot Operating System). These files are used by ROS program to tell the computer what the robot actually loos like in real life. URDF files are needed in order for ROS to understand and be able to simulate situations with the robot before a researcher actually acquires the robot.
