# Crusader
[![ROS versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS%20versions-Melodic-brightgreen)](https://wiki.ros.org)
## Overview
Many mobile robots use a drive mechanism known as differential drive. It consists of 2 drive wheels mounted on a common axis, and each wheel can independently being driven either forward or backward. 
This is a completely learning based project to understand the basics of Robot Operating System and Gazebo by making a **differential drive robot *simulation***. The bot, called Crusader, will be able to navigate an environment with obstacles autonomously. 

## Note
No prior skills, except basic programming knowledge in Python, are required for this project. Ubuntu 18.04 (https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) is required.
